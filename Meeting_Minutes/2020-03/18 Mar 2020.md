## 3. Discussion

We demoed the system to Madhu and Charles. She likes how you can add someone to the timetable multiple times at once using the repeat button, and she thinks the report generation is going to be very useful for her. 

Our priorities now are to improve the GUI and continue working on the report. 

We need to make sure to write good deployment notes for the software manual. Madhu and Charles can give us more information about what is needed in the deployment notes. 

Dario is going to ask Geert how we can share access to the code with Capital One from our GitLab. We've also asked Madhu and Charles to try to run the software using their machines to check there's no compatibility issues.  

We want to catch up again in two weeks, at the same time.
