## 3. Discussion

Because the system is nearly complete, we want to start thinking about writing the final report. The group report, individual report and peer assessment is due on Wednesday 6th May. 

Since the final report an extension of the interim report, we need to first find a better structure to use rather than copying the structure from the interim report. Nicole emailed Dario to get some suggestions on how to structure the report. 

Structure:

·     Introduction – explanation of what the brief was and what has been achieved

·     The initial requirements and how they changed

·     How the project has been managed. Documentation and the dynamic of the team

·     The technical approach to the project. Tools and methods used and if they changed

·     User manual on how to use the system, and software manual on how a future developer could add more features. Future plans for the projects

·     Reflection on the project – difficulties we faced
