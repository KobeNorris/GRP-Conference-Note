After some discussion with my teammates, we found all of us are free on Thu=
rsday afternoon. So, in order to begin the project ASAP, could we raise thi=
s conference on next Thursday (on 5th Nov) afternoon from 2 o'clock in Capi=
tal One's office in station street.
 Is that fine for you? Considering that you have not watched our presentati=
on yet, shall we present again to you exclusively?</div>
