### 3. Work progress

```
Gurjyot Kaur: Gurj designed the administrator login page and made a professional looking GUI 

Kejia Wu: Kobe showed his rostering timetable, which includes three coloured rows to represent the employee roles, and greys out the days that are outside of the current month.

Liam Orrill: Liam has a page where you enter when you want to roster an employee onto the timetable and what role they'll have, and stores this information in a database. This work can be combined with Kobe's so that the timetable displays when employees are rostered. 

Nicole Millinship: Nicole created a page which displays all employee's information, including holiday and deployments, in the database.

Teana Rashid: Teana created a form so the user could change their profile details, and this information is submitted to a database. This work can now be combined with Nicole's.  

Xuanhao Li: Leo validated the administrator login system, ensuring that the username and password entered is correct, and either logs the admin in or sends them back to the login page. This work can be combined with Gurj's.

### 5. Our Requirements Queries

> *The associate must not be in their probation period usually 3 months after joining.* 

This is the 'status' attribute, which can either be active or inactive for each employee. This would be set manually by the administrator.  However should an employee who is on their probation period be considered 'active' (i.e they are active because their probation is active), or 'inactive' (i.e they're inactive because they can't be added to the rostering system whilst on probation). <br>

> *The associate must have a performance rating of ‘Strong’ or ‘AboveStrong’ Where the associate had a performance rating of Strong and then dropped to ‘Below Strong’ they can no longer participate on the support rota. However, if they move to ‘Strong’ in the next quarter, they would be allowed to participate in the rota.*

Is this still required? If so how is the performance rating calculated? If every employee had a 'Below Strong' rating then surely no one would be able to be allocated onto the timetable. <br>

What counts as 'immediately' here; one day, two days, etc. after their holiday? <br>

> *The associate must not be the implementer of any overnight deployments during their rota week*

If an employee is doing an overnight deployment on Tuesday night, then what do they put as the start and end date of their deployment? Do they put Tuesday to Wednesday or just Tuesday? Are all deployments overnight or can some just be during one day? <br>

> *The associate must appear no more than once every ‘n-2’ weeks (given there are ‘n’ associates on the rota)*

Again, what happens if there is no choice but to make an employee be timetabled twice in a row, because the other employees are busy? If the administrator tries to roster someone when they've appeared more than every 'n-2' weeks, should they receive a warning from the system, but should still be allowed to roster them?
