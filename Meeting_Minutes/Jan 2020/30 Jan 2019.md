## 3. Discussion

The sponsor meeting is on Thursday, 6th February at 3-5pm, where we'll demo our work to Madhu.

Our team wants to improve our communication, and we have these suggestions: 

- We should write a summary of each meeting that we can send to Dario (and the rest of the team).
- We should chat over Microsoft Teams
- We should expect a response from somebody typically within 24 hours

- Kobe - perform testing
- Liam - auto-email system
- Teana - drag and dropping employees onto the timetable
-  Nicole - integrate her employee work with the system
