## 3. Discussion

The date for the presentation at Capital One is on Monday 11th May. The date for the university showcase is on Wednesday 13th May.

We showed the system to Madhu and Charles, and they're happy with the progress so far.

We discussed the problems with implementing the email system, and Madhu gave advice on how to implement it. Charles suggested Gurj used bootstrap to design the css. 

We have agreed to meet Madhu and Charles again on Wednesday 11th March at 4pm on Jubilee Campus, as long as all the team are available.
