### 3. Discussion

We pitched for the three projects. We think that the pitches went fairly well and we tried to make sure that every member of the group had a chance to speak. When ordering our preferences for which project we wanted, we put Galaxian first, Support Engineers Rostering second, and Intensive Care third, as we believe that the Galaxian pitch went the best. 

On the 24th October Geert emailed us to say that we got Support Engineers Rostering as our project. We have emailed our project sponsor Madhu so that we can set up a meeting with her. We have also emailed our project supervisor Dario so that we can complete the Preliminary Ethics Checklist with him for the 30th October. 

We are now going to allocate features that we need to create for the project to each team member.
