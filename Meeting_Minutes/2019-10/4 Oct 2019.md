## 3. Discussion

On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday we got to sign up to the projects we wanted; Galaxian, Rostering system and Intensive care support. Now we need to begin writing our Expressions of Interests for these three projects, which is due on Wednesday 16th October. 

We also need to submit our CVs on the same day. Each team member needs to submit their CV so they can be assessed individually, but everyone's CVs are also included with the Expression of Interest submission.
