### 3. Main problem

    Our team is actully quite weak in comparison with some of the others (which have exp of APP developing, Unity software deveploing and Intel managing).

    Most of the projects are too ambitious and require AI / Deep learning / Machine learning / NLP / ATS / Node.js techs, which could be difficult for us to start from the beginning.

    More details could be looked up from the JSON document named ProjectDetail.JSON.
