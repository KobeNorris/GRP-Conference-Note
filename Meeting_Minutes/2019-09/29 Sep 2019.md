### 3. Main problem

    Our team doesn't have much experience outside of what has been learnt in university. We think that most of the projects are too ambitious and require AI / Deep learning / Machine learning / NLP / ATS / Node.js techs, which could be difficult for us to start learning from scratch.
    
    More details about our thoughts on the projects can be seen in the JSON document named ProjectDetail.JSON.
