# Support Engineer Rostering

## Project Sponsor

Capital One -- Nottingham Customer

## Project Description

Capital One's engineers in the team or a set of teams provide support for one week at a time. Three roles are assigned as part of the allocation *primary engineer*, *secondary engineer* and *escalation manager*. The rota is being manually maintained usually by the manager and the ask of this project is to automate the rota based on certain criteria:

1. The associate must not be in their probation period usually 3 months after joining;

2. The associate must have a performance rating of ‘Strong’ or ‘Above Strong’ Where the associate had a performance rating of Strong and then dropped to ‘Below Strong’ they can no longer participate on the support rota. However, if they move to ‘Strong’ in the next quarter, they would be allowed to participate in the rota;

3. The associate must not be on holiday during their rota week;

4. The associate must not be on holiday immediately before their rota week;

5.  The associate must not be the implementer of any overnight deployments during their rota week;

6. The associate must appear no more than once every ‘n-2’ weeks (given there are ‘n’ associates on the rota).

The rota must also allow for short and sudden changes - i.e., if the associate is off sick during their rota week, it must be possible for the manager to choose another person on the rota. 
 
The system should be able to produce a report on how many times an engineer has been on support.  
 
As a stretch challenge, the project can be extended to automatically email the manager when an associate has completed their on-call week and request for approval. This will enable the manager to process the approval and notify payroll proactively.
